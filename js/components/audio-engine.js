/* =====================================================================
 *  AUDIO — the tetrad as four sounding voices
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * The oscillators are Xenachord's: the same two timbre families over the same
 * four shapes, the same band-limited tables, the same ADSR, run a sample at a
 * time in ../synth/voice-processor.js. Nothing about the sound is defined
 * here — this file is only the part that is Tetrads' own, which is how a
 * chord becomes four notes and what happens when the pointer moves to the
 * next one.
 *
 * FOUR IDS, HELD.  A voice is a part, not a note: id 0 is the bass for as
 * long as the app is sounding, and moving to the next tetrad leads that same
 * voice to its new pitch rather than stopping it and starting another. That
 * is what Enable Slide is — see voice.glide — and it is why the ids are fixed
 * rather than allocated per chord. With slide off the same four ids are
 * re-struck, so a voice still belongs to one part either way.
