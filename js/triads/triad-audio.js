/* =====================================================================
 *  TRIADS — three voices, one gesture
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES.  Isoharmonics sounds the triangle by generating a
 * looping buffer for the chord under the pointer, playing it, and fading the
 * previous one out over half a second. Every pointer move does this again. The
 * consequences are audible and all of them are the same consequence: a drag is
 * a stream of note-ons. Each new buffer starts its own attack, so the chord is
 * re-struck dozens of times a second; each old one is still fading, so up to
 * ten copies of nearly the same chord overlap and beat against each other; and
 * because a buffer has to be built before it can be heard, the pitch arrives
 * after the hand. A timer even nudges the cursor in a small circle while it is
 * held still, to keep re-triggering something that should simply be sustaining.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS HERE.  Three voices are struck ONCE, when the pointer goes
 * down, and they are not struck again until it is lifted and put down
 * somewhere else. Moving the pointer sends those same three running voices a
 * glide — see voice.js, and the per-sample interpolation in the worklet — so
 * the triad slides continuously through the field with one attack at the
 * beginning and one release at the end. Holding still is silence-free without
 * a timer, because a sustaining voice sustains.
 *
 * That is not merely tidier; it is what makes the mode work as an instrument.
 * The whole point of dragging across a dissonance surface is to hear the chord
 * bend through it, and an attack on every frame is exactly the event that
 * hides a bend.
 *
 * THE PIVOT.  One voice is held at a fixed pitch for the whole session and the
 * other two are measured from it, so that dragging changes the chord's shape
 * rather than sliding the whole thing up the spectrum. Which voice that is can
 * be changed while sounding: the new pivot inherits the pitch it currently
 * has, so the switch is silent and the chord does not jump.

/**
 * The simplest just triad the pointer could be said to be on.
 *
 * A point on a continuous surface is not in just intonation, but the readout
 * and the notation engines only speak in enumerated chords — so the sounding
 * position has to be given a name. The obvious way is to approximate each
 * interval on its own and multiply the two fractions out, and it is wrong:
 * two independent convergents with denominators under a hundred multiply into
 * chords like 646:782:943, which is not a name for anything.
 *
 * So the search is over the CHORD rather than over its intervals. A triad
 * whose bottom voice is i has its other two fixed by the position — j is i·r1
 * rounded, k is i·r1·r2 — so walking i upward walks candidate triads in
 * order of increasing complexity, and the first one that lands within
 * tolerance of both intervals is the simplest reading there is. That is what
 * makes a major third read as 4:5:6.
 *
 * @returns {{label: string, error: number}} the chord, and how many cents the
 *          worse of its two intervals is from where the pointer actually is.
