 * ITS OWN SCENE.  The tetrahedron's renderer is left completely alone. Sharing

 * OrbitControls the tetrahedron's Play mode switches off, and a key handler
 * that turns the whole scene — and in "Both" the two would have to be on

 *
 * PICKING IS ARITHMETIC, NOT SEARCH.  Isoharmonics finds the chord under the
 * pointer by projecting every hundredth mesh vertex to the screen and taking
 * the nearest, which is slow, misses by up to a hundred vertices, and needs
 * PyOpenGL for the projection. The surface here is a height field over a known

 * and the hit point IS the chord: its x and y are the two intervals, exactly,

 * lives in — the three corners of the triangle, at the ground and at the top
 * of the relief. This used to be the eight corners of the surface's BOUNDING
 * BOX, which is a rectangular block half of which the triangle does not
 * occupy, so the frame was solved against a phantom that stuck out past the
 * shape on one side and the picture sat off-centre by the difference.
 *
 * HOW IT IS CENTRED: IN SCREEN SPACE, NOT IN CAMERA SPACE.  The obvious thing
 * is to measure the corners along the camera's own axes and aim at the middle
 * of what they span. That is an ORTHOGRAPHIC answer, and this is a perspective
 * camera: depth changes how far from the centre a point lands, so the near
 * corners throw out further than the far ones and the true middle of the
 * picture is not the middle of the span. Solving it that way left the surface
 * sitting 7% right of centre and low in the pane.
 *
 * So the corners are PROJECTED and the answer is iterated. Each pass puts the
 * camera where the current guess says, projects the six corners, and reads off
 * how far the picture's box is from the centre of the frame and how much of
 * the frame it fills; the target slides by the first and the distance scales
 * by the second. It converges in a handful of passes because each correction
 * is very nearly right, and it costs six projections a pass on a routine that
 * runs when the pane changes size — not per frame.
 *
 * A bounding sphere would be simpler and would waste most of the pane: a
 * triangle with a low relief is a wide flat thing, and the sphere that holds
 * it is mostly empty air above and below.
 *
 * The DIRECTION is read from the camera and never written, so a surface the
 * user has turned stays turned.
 */
/**
 * A thinned copy of what is actually being drawn, for the framing to aim at.
 *
 * The frame used to be solved against the triangular PRISM — the footprint
 * swept from the ground to the height of the tallest peak. The footprint is
 * exact, but the lid is not: it is a flat ceiling at peak height stretched
 * over the whole triangle, and almost all of it is empty air, because a peak
 * is a peak precisely by being somewhere rather than everywhere. Framing
 * against that reserved room at the top of the pane for nothing, and pushed
 * the picture down by a couple of percent.
 *
 * So the surface says where it really is — but not with every vertex, which
 * would be tens of thousands of points to settle a hull.
 *
 * WHICH POINTS ARE KEPT IS NOT A MATTER OF TASTE.  A plain stride is the
 * obvious thinning and it is wrong here: the points that decide the outline
 * are the ones on the edge of the mask, and a stride steps straight over most
 * of them. Framed against what was left, the picture came out believing it was
 * narrower than it is and overflowed the margin it was supposed to be sitting
 * inside — 97% of the pane against the 94% asked for.
 *
 * So the EDGE is taken in full — the first and last live vertex of every row
 * and of every column, which is the exact footprint and cheap at a few hundred
 * points — and the interior is thinned by stride on top of it, since an
 * interior point only ever matters if it is a peak. The highest vertex is kept
 * by name, because that one is never optional and a stride can miss it.

 *  The flat pane keeps the plain drag for playing, because there is nothing to
 *  turn there; Shift plays in both, so the habit carries whichever pane the
