/* =====================================================================
 *  WHICH APP YOU ARE IN
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Three modes now, over the same set: a LINE of dyads, a TRIANGLE of triads, a
 * TETRAHEDRON of tetrads. One voice more each time, and one dimension.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE.  With two modes the switch could live inside one
 * of them and read as "the other one" — and it did, in triad-mode.js. With
 * three that stops being true: a mode is no longer the complement of the mode
 * you are in, and a switch written from inside any one of them would have to
 * know about the other two. So the modes are registered here and the switch
 * knows only what every mode has in common:
 *
 *   title    what the drawers call themselves while it is up
 *   view     what the stage should be laying out
 *   resize   the panes it owns, when the stage changes size
 *   enter    what it needs on the way in — generating, fitting, rebuilding
 *   leave    what it must let go of on the way out
 *
 * Nothing in here imports a mode. The modes import this, and hand it their
 * hooks, in the same idiom the tetrahedron's builder was already registered
 * with — which is what keeps a fourth picture from being a fourth branch here.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT A MODE SETTING.  The limit, the equave, the complexity measure,
 * the colormap, the synth and the notation are shared by all three and stay
 * where they are; see read-panel.js. A control that genuinely belongs to one
 * mode is marked `data-mode` in the markup and hidden by applyModeClasses
 * below, rather than removed, so it keeps its value across a switch and comes
 * back set the way you left it.
