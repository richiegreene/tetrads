/* =====================================================================
 *  THE COLOUR LAYOUTS
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Everything that colours anything reads this one table: the panel's chips are
 * painted by sampling it, the tetrahedron's sprites are baked from it, and the
 * triangle's shading, contours, dots and surface all come out of it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ON OFFER, AND WHY ONLY THESE.  Five ramps, and they are matplotlib's
 * five perceptually uniform sequential maps — viridis, plasma, inferno, magma,
 * cividis. "Perceptually uniform" is the whole selection rule: equal steps in
 * complexity have to look like equal steps in colour, or the picture says
 * something the numbers do not. The ramps this replaced were hand-picked
 * gradients through arbitrary stops, and a hand-picked gradient banded — it
 * invented edges where the field was smooth and flattened real ridges where
 * two of its stops happened to sit close together. Cividis earns its place
 * separately: it is the one of the five that survives red-green colour
 * blindness with its ordering intact.
 *
 * THE GROUND IS NO LONGER PART OF A LAYOUT.  It used to be: there were two
 * columns of chips, a dark set drawn on black and a bright set drawn on paper,
 * and picking a ramp also picked a background. That made twelve chips for what
 * is really two decisions, and it meant the only way to read Magma on white
 * was to give up Magma. The ground is now the app's theme — one toggle at the
 * foot of the rail — and every layout is drawn on whichever ground is up.
 *
 * On a light ground the ramps are sampled backwards. This is not a second
 * palette, it is the same ramp read the other way: a ramp's bright end is its
 * signal end, and on black the simplest chords should glow while on paper they
 * should go to ink. Leaving the direction alone would put the simplest chords
 * — the ones the picture exists to show — at pale yellow on white paper, which
 * is to say nowhere.
 *
 * GRADIENT LAYOUTS vs THE CONSTANT.  The five ramps turn value into hue, and
 * the 3D surface is coloured per-vertex so its height and its colour say the
 * same thing twice. That is legible, and it is also flat — every facet is lit
 * identically, so the shape reads as a contour map that happens to be tilted.
 *
 * CONSTANT does the opposite. The surface is one colour — the colour YOU pick,
 * from the swatch on its chip — and all of the modelling comes from light: an
 * angled key, a soft fill, and a specular highlight that slides across the
 * peaks as the shape turns. Height stops being redundant with colour and
 * starts being the only thing carrying the model, which is what makes a
 * shallow ridge you would miss in a ramp visible as a ridge. The flat pane
 * renders it as hillshading — the same light on the same surface, seen from
 * directly above — so the two panes stay two views of one thing. Its chip is
 * drawn as a rectangle of flat colour rather than as a gradient strip,
 * because that is what the layout is.
