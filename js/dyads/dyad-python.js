/* =====================================================================
 *  DYADS — the Python behind the curve
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Four things are asked of Python in Dyads mode, and they are asked here so
 * that main.js writes one file and the rest of the app never touches a source
 * string again:
 *
 *   generate_dyads            which dyads exist at all, under the same limit,
 *                             equave and complexity settings the other two
 *                             modes are built from — theory/calculations.py is
 *                             imported rather than reimplemented, so a limit
 *                             means the same thing in all three.
 *   harmonic_entropy_curve    the triangle's entropy model, one dimension down.
 *   sethares_curve            sensory dissonance against the loaded timbre.
 *   tenney_curve              the Tenney norm made continuous.
 *
 * THE MEASURES, AND WHY THERE ARE FOUR KINDS.  A complexity measure on a
 * RATIO is cheap and there are six of them in the Complexity drawer already —
 * Tenney, Weil, Wilson, Euler, Benedetti, Arithmetic — and every one of them
 * is defined only AT the ratios. They say nothing about 351 cents, which is
 * not any ratio, so they can stand a lattice up and cannot draw a curve. That
 * is the mode's first setting. The other three are the families that are
 * defined EVERYWHERE:
 *
 *   PROBABILISTIC   harmonic entropy: how many simple readings the ear has to
 *                   choose between at this interval.
 *   PHYSICAL        Sethares: partial beating against partial, so it depends
 *                   on the timbre and not at all on the arithmetic.
 *   ARITHMETIC      the Tenney norm with a parabola let down from every ratio,
 *                   so the space between ratios has a value too. This is the
 *                   continuous extension the published comparison found fits
 *                   listeners better than any of the discrete measures.
 *
 * Nothing here draws. Each model returns the raw curve over a fixed grid and
 * everything else — the colouring, the drawing, the export — is done in JS,
 * for the same reason the triangle's models do: a picture cannot be
 * recoloured, refitted or emitted as vectors without being computed again.
