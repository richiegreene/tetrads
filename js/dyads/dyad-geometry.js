/* =====================================================================
 *  DYADS — the plot, as arithmetic
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * The canvas, the SVG exporter, the curve returned by Python and the interval
 * that sounds are four readings of one number, so the conversions between them
 * live here rather than three times over.
 *
 * THE NUMBER.  c is the interval in cents, from 0 at the unison to the width
 * of the axis — the equave taken `span` times over. A dyad is therefore a
 * point on a segment, and the picture is that segment laid along the bottom of
 * a box with the measure's value going up:
 *
 *     t = c / C          v = (z - min) / (max - min)
 *
 * with C the axis in cents. Sample 0 of the returned curve is the unison and
 * sample n-1 is the far end, so a curve index, a screen pixel and an interval
 * are the same point counted three ways — the same arrangement the triangle
 * uses, one dimension down.
