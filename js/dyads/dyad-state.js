 *  DYADS — what the mode is currently set to
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * The triangle keeps its settings in triad-state.js and the tetrahedron keeps
 * its in globals.js, for the reason the three have separate drawers: a control
 * that only exists in one mode has no business being read in another, and a
 * single store would make it impossible to tell which those are.
 *
 * What is NOT here is anything genuinely shared — the limit, the equave, the
 * complexity measure, the colormap, the synth, the notation. Those are read
 * from the same inputs the other two modes read; see read-panel.js.

 * Which measure the plot is a picture of.

 *
 *   discrete WHICHEVER OF THE SIX the Complexity drawer is set to — Tenney,
 *            Weil, Wilson, Euler, Benedetti, Arithmetic. These are functions
 *            of a ratio's two numbers, so they have a value AT every just
 *            interval and none at all between them: no curve, only the height
 *            of the lattice itself.
 *   he       HARMONIC ENTROPY. How many simple readings of the interval the
 *            ear has to choose between. Probabilistic, and knows nothing
 *            about timbre.
 *   sethares SENSORY DISSONANCE. Partial against partial, from the spectrum
 *            of whatever wave is loaded in the Play drawer. Physical, and
 *            knows nothing about arithmetic.
 *   tenney   THE TENNEY NORM, MADE CONTINUOUS. log2(pq) at every ratio, with
 *            a parabola let down from each one so the space between them has
 *            a value too. Arithmetic, and knows nothing about ears.
 *
 * Nine measures between them, and they disagree. The Ratings overlay is what
 * lets you see which of them is right about a listener.
