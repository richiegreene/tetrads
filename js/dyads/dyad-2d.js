/* =====================================================================
 *  DYADS — the plot
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * One pane and no second view, because there is nothing for a second view to
 * disagree about: a dyad has one degree of freedom, so the picture is a curve
 * and a curve says where AND how deep in the same mark. The triangle needs a
 * contour map and a lifted surface side by side precisely because it cannot.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRAWN, BOTTOM TO TOP.  The ground, the ruler, the curve — shaded
 * under and stroked over — then the JI lattice stemmed up to it, then the
 * measured listeners, then the cursor. Everything is placed from the two-line
 * mapping in dyad-geometry.js, so a curve index, a screen pixel and an
 * interval are the same point counted three ways and the exporter can emit the
 * whole picture as real vectors.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO READ IT, AND THE PANEL DECIDES WHICH.  With Grid on it is a
 * plot: a ruler in cents, a marked vertical axis, a frame. With Grid off all
 * of that goes, the margins it was being kept for go with it, and what is left
 * is the measure drawn across the pane. The second is not a degraded first —
 * the shape of a concordance curve is legible without a single number on it,
 * and once you know what the axes are the furniture is only in the way.
