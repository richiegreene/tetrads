# Tetrads
Interactive tetrahedron of JI tetrads with the ability to scale via harmonic complexity models.  
Sounds, shapes, colors ... Go nuts!

### Display Controls
* Rotate Tetrahedron: click/drag or arrow keys
* Zoom: two-finger scroll/mouse-wheel
### Playback Controls
* Shift: hover to play corresponding chord
* Shift+Hover(Click Hold): sustain a chord; next chord on release
* s, a, t, b keys to toggle the pivot/common-tone between adjacent chords

### Display Settings
* Select [Odd-limit](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Odd_limit) of considered JI tetrads
* Select the register considered
  * default "2" for a 2/1 octave
* Set [Complexity Model](https://en.xen.wiki/w/User:Sintel/Validation_of_common_consonance_measures) that size/color displays correspond to
* Display: Points (Dots) or Labels (Enumerated Ratios)
* Notation: depicts played chord as ratio or cents
  * Refference pitch: 1/1 = C3 130.8128Hz
* Base Size: Set minimum size (e.g. 0.25) of Point/Label
* Scaling Factor: adjust to change rate of sizing/coloration difference
* Omit Unisons/Octaves to display only chords with unique pitch classes
### Playback Settings
* Enable Slide: set duration (sec) of portamento for adjacent SATB voices
* Set pivot voice (common-tone) with S A T B buttons (or keys)
### Info
Approaching this as a sort of 3D take off of Sintel's [triangle](https://sintel.website/posts/triangle.html). While drawing inspiration from tetradic [harmonic entropy](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Harmonic_entropy) (4HE) this does not render 3D gaussian (multivariate normal) distributions, which are certainly pivotal when considering HE.
